# HW-OCR
In this repository, several approaches are implemented to solve the HTR problem. Three approaches are presented for processing feature sequences: fully convolutional, RNN-base and Attention-RNN based. HKR dataset is used to train and test models. 
Model weights can be found in the pretrained models folder.
Examples of jupyter notebooks for training models are located in the Notebooks folder.
