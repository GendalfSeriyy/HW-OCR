# HW-OCR
In this repository, several approaches are implemented to solve the HTR problem. Three approaches are presented for processing feature sequences: fully convolutional, RNN-base and Attention-RNN based (based on https://github.com/bai-shang/crnn_seq2seq_ocr_pytorch and https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.03915)))))). 
HKR dataset (https://github.com/abdoelsayed2016/HKR_Dataset) is used to train and test models. 
Model weights can be found in the pretrained models folder.
Examples of jupyter notebooks for training models are located in the Notebooks folder.
Example for testing models is located in Notebook/test.ipynb
